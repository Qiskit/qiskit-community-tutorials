# Introductory Quantum Information Science with Qiskit Terra

This folder hosts notebooks on the basics of Quantum Information Science.

* [Quantum Superposition](superposition.ipynb): introduces how a quantum bit can be both "0" and "1", and how it behaves
differently from a probabilistic bit.

* [Quantum Amplitude and Phase](amplitude_and_phase.ipynb): shows how to control quantum superposition of a qubit by changing amplitude and phase with quantum gates.

* [Quantum Entanglement](entanglement_introduction.ipynb): introduces the concept of entangled qubits by showing quantum correlation between two qubits by applying CNOT gates.

* [Testing Quantum Entanglement](entanglement_testing.ipynb): performs experiments to test quantum correlation proving quantum entanglement is different from classical correlation.

* [Teleportation and Superdense Coding](teleportation_superdensecoding.ipynb): shows how quantum entanglement can be used to teleport (sending quantum information without moving) a qubit, and encode two-bit of information in a qubit.

* [Basis Gate Decomposition of Arbitrary Single-Qubit Operators and Their Controlled Versions](Basis_Gate_Decomposition_of_Arbitrary_Single_Qubit_Operators.ipynb): shows how to find basis gate decomposition of arbitrary 2x2 unitary matrix and its 4x4 controlled version via two methods: using the built-in U3 gate, on the one hand, and performing the ZYZ decomposition, on the other.

* [Basis Gate Decomposition of Arbitrary Two-Qubit Operators and Their Controlled Versions](Basis_Gate_Decomposition_of_Arbitrary_Two_Qubit_Operators.ipynb): shows how to find basis gate decomposition of arbitrary 4x4 unitary matrix via the built-in two_qubit_cnot_decompose function and its 8x8 controlled version via diagonalization of the 4x4 matrix.
